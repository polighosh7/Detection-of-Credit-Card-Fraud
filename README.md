Abstract 
Now-a-days, Internet has become an important part of humanâ€™s life, a person can shop, invest, and perform all the banking task online. Due to the rise and rapid growth of E-Commerce, use of credit cards for online purchases has dramatically increased and it caused an explosion in the credit card fraud. In an era of digitalization, credit card fraud detection is of great importance to financial institutions. In this presentation, we will analyze credit card fraud detection using several Machine Learning classification Algorithms. After analyzing, our aim is to compare all the different methods to handle imbalanced data. The obtained results from databases of credit card transactions show the power of these techniques in the fight against banking fraud comparing them to others in the same field. It was determined that the Logistic Regression algorithm for Over-sampling and Decision Tree for Under-sampling had the highest performance rate for detecting credit card fraud under realistic conditions.
